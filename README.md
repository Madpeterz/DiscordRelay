Discord Relay bot 
- 
#### it puts the chat in the channel or it gets the hose again
-  image: [madpeter/discord-relay](https://hub.docker.com/r/madpeter/discord-relay) via docker hub

for multiple relay sources add

    Relay_X_server
    Relay_X_channel

starting from 1 and going up

 - to get the required server / channel ids set your discord into dev mode
 - only one relay per server (if this becomes a issue I will think about expanding it)

#### Why?
no idea someone wanted it so here it is but the full Secondbot version was unwanted.
